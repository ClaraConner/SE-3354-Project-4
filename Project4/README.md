### Project Description:
This application would be used to track extracurriculars found at the University of Texas at Dallas
through a calendar-style format, where the extracurriculars to be added could be edited by the user or
an organization leader.

User - This file establishes the User class <br/>
Event - This file establishes the Event class <br/>
Attendees - This file establishes the Event Attendee List using a Linked List <br/>
Test Files: <br/>

### Compilation Guide:
Please ensure the files exist exactly as they were turned it, with the classes in the classes in the 'classes' folder and the tests in the 'tests' folder.  <br/>
Execute a test file by selecting the file in your IDE and clicking 'run.' You will see the tests for the specific file running. <br/>
